After that, I started rewriting some components based on their advice. It took some time to get the hang of it, but I'm happy with the results.  I also spent some time working on the project's styling logic."

Drizzle, I didn't know that yet, so I grabbed the documentation. And PostgreSQL... yeah, it's been a while too. Luckily I could also take a look at some older projects from the team, that helped. But it was quite a puzzle to get everything working."

I received both compliments and comments, so that's nice. I now know what I need to work on. For example, they said that I sometimes draw conclusions too quickly, and that I should think calmly before I start coding something."

I also had to figure out how to optimize my server files. Really no idea what they were talking about, haha! But I figured it out eventually. I googled a bit and watched some tutorials, and then I understood it luckily."

I picked up a few tickets, for example one about adding a new feature to the user interface, and one about improving the performance of the API. I've already written the code and created a PR for it, but now it's just waiting for the review from my colleagues. I feel like I'm working a bit slow, but my colleagues say it's okay. I think I'm on the right track, but working with tickets and PRs takes some getting used to. It's all new to me. Such a PR is quite exciting, because then your code is checked by someone else. But it's also educational, because you get feedback and you learn new things."
